    "# Start to write and record research notes in Jupyter notebook!\n",
    "I am rencently trying to organize my website and all the research project. Also doing a lot of literature review and brainstorming recently. Sometimes I write it done in the papers, sometimes I just read it and easily forget it in 1 day and the most convenient way is starting to wrte study notes in Latex. I use Latex to write papers, so if I write it in the Latex, it will be easy for me to reformatting it to a paper.\n",
    "However, inspired by Dr.Sylvain Deville's blog <a href=\"https://sylvaindeville.net/2015/01/04/the-automated-academic/\">\"The Automated Academic\"</a>, I think maybe I could be a cool \"geek\" as him, let me try to use Jupyter notebook!\n",
    "Beside the resources he metioned in the blog, can I try to writedown my ideas in the iPhone? The answer is \"Yes!\". I found out an IOS app called <a href=\"https://juno.sh/\">\"Juno\"</a>. I haven't used it yet, but seems pretty cool.\n",

    "## How to embed Jupyter notebook in html?\n",
    "I know that you can directly download the jupyter notebook as a html file, but it does not combined well with my website. How can I just embed a Jupyter notebook in a small part of my website page?\n",
    "I found out this blog page: <a href=\"https://sharmamohit.com/work/post/jupyter-notebooks-in-blog/\">\"jupyter notebooks in blog\"</a> and then modified a little bit myself:\n",
    "* Dwonload the notebook to as a normal HTML.\n",
    "* Dwonload the css of Jupyter notebook (<a href=\"https://sharmamohit.com/css/jupyter.css\">Here</a>).\n",
    "* Save the downloaded css file in your website's css file folder.\n",
    "* Change your normal html css styles into the one you just downloaded.\n",
    "* Scroll down the HTML file you just downloaded from Jupyter to the bottom. Copy the main text body and paste it into your normal html file.\n",
    "* Adjusting the layout as you want, for example, I deleted the line to make the text line up to the left:"
